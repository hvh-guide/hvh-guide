# Unique Builds

The general builds have been covered in the FAQs and in sections of the various modes / events. This section will instead show off some interesting and cool builds users have discovered.

If you want your build included as well, send me a DM about it with the details.

## Oracle: Artemis' Perma-Ulti Build

This build revolves around a high duration stat. When testing it out, my Oracle had 70% and above. The idea is that with a high enough duration stat and with required damage, she can charge and trigger the next ultimate while the balls from previous ultimate are still flying around the screen, thus achieving a perma-ultimate state. As of now this build was tested using both full Noble set and the standard all Rogue + Ranger's boots.

Required stat: High value for Effect Duration

`Weapons`: With the standard set of Fire Orbs, Bombs, Lightning, Crossbow

`Tomes`: Duration (most important), Duplicator, Cooldown

- For farming: EXP tome and Coin tome
- For GE / Dungeon: Damage and Crit / Area of Effect

`Jewels`: Standard Jewels: Vulnerability, Ultimate Charge & Ultimate Duration, Cooldown till 60% cap. Chances are if you don't have a high enough effect duration, those jewels could be used to fill the remainder of the slots (instead of Area of Effect) to reach 70%.

Artemis was able to AFK farm TJ5 with this build.
I tested in a Guild level 10 event, whilst wearing legendary and epic pieces of all Rogue + Ranger's boots.
(Results may vary due to globals, talents and forges)
