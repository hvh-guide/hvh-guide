|1) Arena is meant to be a late game event mode. Therefore don't feel discouraged if you can't make that much progress early on.  2) Attempt the best you can each week, but try not to spend gems on multiple revives.|3) 1 to 2 gem revives are fine if its a stage that rewards supers or tokens for a really good weapon such as fire orbs, bombs, or for rare hero weapons (barb, clock, monk) or for arena clearing heroes such as [Blademaster](/docs/hero/blademaster) and [Knight](/docs/hero/knight).|4) When the go-to damage build fails, you can use gear that offer more starting upgrades for a boost. Alternatively, throw in some damage pieces for a bit of both.  5) Higher stages, especially 15 onwards, require survival weapons and kiting if you aren't strong enough.|1) Clockwork Mage - A crowd favorite. Whilst still quite difficult, she has been successful in a full clear, while at 250+ talents, in legendary gear and at level 80, without weapon evolution.  2) Knight - With his RuneSword evolution he is able to full clear.|3) [Blademaster](/docs/hero/blademaster) - his cheese strategy. Can full clear in legendary gear. Very popular for -100% instant-kill curse. However absolutely terrible in -100% Critical Hit Chance curse.  4) Monk with his broken evolution?|

You can go with status effect duration or more projectiles in the forge.|
