Clock can take some getting used to when you first get her. Being used to facing your hero towards the enemy, you'll see that Clock instead attacks to the sides. However this is advantageous if you wedge her between two environmental obstacles. Forcing enemies to converge from the sides, her chrono disks will continuously slow them down and once her ultimate charges, she slows them even more whilst putting them through the grinder. She is a strong hero from early game all the way to late game. She can also achieve Arena 20 full clear with lower gear and talent requirements. She is great for AFK farming in stages where you can force enemies into the choke points. Overall a really good hero for almost all modes.

`Excels in:` Early to Late progression. Guild Events. Arena. AFK Farming.
