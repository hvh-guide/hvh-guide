He starts off below average to average and is heavily reliant on being able to hit enemies to charge his ultimate which is where he really shows off how strong he is. To this effect, if you are using him in earlier content against easier enemies, your other weapons kill off the monster and he does not really get to shine. He is also slow and relies on getting his cooldown capped. His full potentially really shows when you take him into end game content where the enemies are more tanky and he gets to rip them to shreads with his ultimate. Similarly, he is best known for high rank Guild Events during the elite phase of the fight where he can charge up the ultimate to show you why he is called the Reaper.
