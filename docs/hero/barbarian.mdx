He starts off average to above-average but once you get him into ascended gear, and buffed with globals from other heroes, he starts to show his true potential. He has the highest damage ceiling in the game and he excels at taking on late game content. You can use him earlier but results may feel lackluster. Given the highest damage ceiling, as he takes on harder content and begins to take some damage, he begins to increase his own damage, showing just how devastating he can be with his axes.

`Excels in:` Late game progression. Guild Event. Farming in HM stages such as Toxic Jungle 5. If Lucky Wheel item collection returns, he is the best at looting it due to increased movement speed during his rage.
