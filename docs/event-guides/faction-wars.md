# Faction Wars  
  
There is a new mode Faction Wars (FW) where it is like adventure mode, one tile at a time, but the progress is saved. You don't need to re-advance your progress when that faction rolls around again. The goal is to conquer an enemy base / survive 5 minutes. You can repeat the stages for greater rewards.

The factions rotate every 2 days, so there will always be one faction active. There are 20 stages to go for now. And difficulty doesn't scale with progression so basically one fixed difficulty for the entire event. There are plans for 20 additional stages per faction in future updates. Stages 21 to 40 were added in update v1.31.0 on 7th Feb 2024.

You select 3 heroes from the current faction and use them to wage your conquest. Each hero gets 2 flags. One flag is consumed per victory, none are consumed if you fail. If your heroes are weak then progression will be slower since instead of 6 ""free"" advancements, only the strong ones can achieve progress. If you also do not have enough heroes for that faction, then it stands to reason your progress will also be slower. Energy is also consumed for every attempt. Additional flags are ONLY available by purchasing the pass and EACH faction requires it's OWN pass.

You get hero shards, skills books and rune stones as rewards. So everytime you use a hero and succeed, you get shards for them.

## More Information on Flags, boosts, progress & the mode  
  
You get 2 flags PER rotation for EACH hero you use. A total of 6 flags by default. Each rotation lasts 2 days. It will take 10 days for all five factions to have their turn before the cycle repeats.

F2P players can get a MAX of 6 flags if they have 3 heroes. Each chosen hero gets 2. (3 x 2 = 6).
Gold pass players can get a MAX of 9 flags if they have 3 heroes. Each chosen hero gets 3. (3 x 3 = 9).
Diamond pass players can get a MAX of 12 flags if they have 3 heroes. Each chosen hero gets 3. Plus there are 3 additional faction flags for ANY of the 3 heroes to use (3 x 3 + 3 = 12).

You MUST select ALL your heroes before starting and CANNOT CHANGE NOR ADD after you begin.

You will ONLY be able to advance based on the number of heroes you have chosen. Meaning if you selected only ONE hero, you will ONLY be able to use the flags of THAT hero, thus limiting your progress. For example, if you are F2P, you can get a maximum of 6 flags if you SELECT THREE heroes, but if you chose just ONE hero, you can only advance 2 spots because that hero ONLY has 2 flags to use.

Factions rotate every 2 days. Flags do NOT replenish at daily reset, ONLY at NEXT rotation. It takes 2 days before the NEXT faction starts, 10 days for the SAME faction to come around.

If you buy boosts, note that EACH faction has it's OWN set of boosts. Meaning EACH faction has to be boosted individually. 5 separate boosts to cover all 5 factions. The boosts are PERMANENT.

The +3 Extra Faction Flags (from Diamond Boost) can be used by ANY of the 3 heroes you have selected.

Faction difficulty has it's own fixed scaling.

As of right now, it seems the only way to receive skill books from FW is by buying boosts.

Upgrading from one boost to the next tier provides a discounted cost of the new tier, though overall slightly more expensive than if you had initially just bought that higher tier first.

Instant Kill is disabled in Faction Wars.

## How to play Faction Wars
  
First you will need to select three heroes from the faction to participate. These are the three heroes that will receive shards so choose wisely. You cannot change your choice later on. Neither can you ADD heroes if you picked less than three. Try to use your weaker heroes first in order to progress further since advancing might get dicey as difficulty does progress.  
  
When you click on a tile to advance, you will see the rewards to be gained, as well as the blessings and curses. You can change the hero you want to use by clicking on the portrait to the left of the PLAY button.
  
There are two types of stages: Conquest and Survival. Survival is a 5 minutes survival stage just like adventure mode.  
  
### Conquest Stage  

There are 6 distinct phases, each with their own specific objective. There is a time limit for each phase. The objective must be completed within this time limit.

Conquest stages from Stage 15 onwards can pose a significant DPS check. It is advisable to save your STRONGEST hero for these stages and allow the rest of the roster clear out the survival stages."  
  
Phase 1 - Survive (30 Seconds).  
  
Phase 2 - Reach Enemy Base (60 Seconds). You need to follow the large red arrow till you reach the enemy base.
  
Phase 3 - Capture Enemy Base (60 Seconds). There are FOUR glowing circles on the ground. Each one has a cannon that will rotate and fire at the enemy base so you can bring down the shield. You must stand in each circle for 10 seconds for the cannon to fire. As such do not delay going between cannons.  
  
Phase 4 - Destroy Enemy Base (60 Seconds). The Enemy Base now has a HP bar. When HP is depleted within the time limit, the objective will complete.  
  
Phase 5 - Build Faction Camp (60 Seconds). There will be a glowing circle on the spot where the enemy base used to be. Stand in it to rebuild faction camp. It takes 20 seconds for the HP bar to fill before objective is completed.  
  
Phase 6 - Survive (60 Seconds).  
  
### Gearing for Faction Wars  

For new players, use the highest rarity equipment you have.

You can use Knight set for more survivability. Or you can also go with Rogue set + Ranger boots for more damage.

Ascended Wizard boots are best in slot for FW for the auto XP collect.

Ideally you want to jewel with Vulnerability, Ultimate Charge, Ultimate Duration, Cooldown > AoE > anything else.

You may also consider swapping certain pieces out to start with maximum upgrades: Legendary Noble Helm, Legendary Wizards Chest, Ascended Wizards Amulet. Fill the rest of the slots with what you feel you need (Knight for survivability, Rogue set + Ranger boots)

Once you are strong enough and find the difficulty manageable you can choose to wear Noble set and Key / Coin Jewels just to get keys and more coins (from each level past max upgrades) from clearing the stages.
  
### Weapon Selection  

The standard meta build works if you are strong enough.

If you find yourself struggling, prioritize survival weaponry: Divine Aura + Regeneration tome, Ice Wand + Life tome, Fire Orbs + Duplicator, Hammers + Crit work really well. The aim is to survive afterall.
  
#### Update 01  

From Stage 10 onwards FW difficulty begins to increase. From Stage 15 onwards, the bases become significantly more tanky. Survival stages as well require strong survivability along with damage so you don't get over run during the first few minutes.

As such, save your strongest DPS hero for the Conquest stages to destroy bases. For survival stages, go with more survivability based weaponry and tomes.
