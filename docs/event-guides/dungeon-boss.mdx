# Dungeon Boss Guide

Boss Brawl is an event where a specific faction will fight a boss over the course of a few days. You can only use a hero associated with that faction and this can cause issues for new / mid game players who may not have a hero from all factions, nor have them levelled up high enough to receive top tier scores.

Gear wise the usual Full Rogue + Ascended Wizards Boots (for XP attraction) / Ranger boots are the standard choice. As for jewels: Vulnerability and Critical are the best options. Ultimate jewels aren't needed since you likely won't get to charge and use it within the run and with just the boss being the main target, AoE jewels aren't necessary. You can consider movement jewels if you need to get faster to be able to kite the boss. However for weapons, the main idea is to level your hero's weapon and also Arcane Staff (Laser) and evolve it with Duration tome as soon as possible. Other complimentary weapons and tomes include: Bombs, Damage, Crit, Cooldown, and Movement Speed (to kite the boss). Majority of your score will come from Death Ray. Mix and match to revolve your build around surviving and dealing damage with your main weapon and Death Ray.

Based on your score there are specific rewards and a promotion. Poor performers will get demoted down a rank. It can be difficult to get a podium finish as whales do tend to dominate, especially at higher league ranking. Boss Brawl difficulty is based on  the rank of the league you are currently in.
