# Guild Event Guide  
  
Guild Event is a weekly event that lasts for 6 days. You get ONE ticket per day and if it is not used, you will NOT get another ticket as the maximum limit is one, unless a boost is purchased by a guild member. If there is a boost, you must use any extra tickets before the daily reset, otherwise you will not receive a new ticket.

In this event, you will have to kill as many enemies as you can within 5 minutes. The first 2:45 minutes of the event, the enemies are regular minions, and the rest of the duration, the enemies are elites.

For early and mid game players, it might not be possible to survive all 5 minutes. As such there can be a focus on survivability based weapons. The standard gear of Full Rogue + Ranger boots is the go to build. Using Assassin jewel can help boost your score as well since it works against the regular minions, however it will have no effect once the elites start spawning. Mid-Late game players would benefit from switching it out for another Cooldown / Area of Effect jewel instead. As always the rest of the jewel slots are filled with: Vulnerability, Ultimate Charge, Ultimate Duration, Cooldown and Area of Effect.

Weapons wise for early and mid gamers: Bombs + Area tome, Fire Orbs + Duplicator, Lightning + Cooldown. For more damage you can take Damage + Dragon's Breath and Crit; or for more survivability take Ice Wand + Life tome and finish off with Damage tome.

For mid-late game players, the same build can be used, however use Crossbow as your final weapon, taking both Damage & Crit tomes. You can also choose to drop Fire Orbs and instead take Poison Darts for more projectiles.
Do not pair Hammer if you have Crit because the pushback from the evo will reduce your score.

At the end of the event, the total score earned by everyone in the guild will be used to determine the number of Guild Tokens received. You will receive them in your in-game mail which you must click to collect. These tokens are used to purchase Guild Store specific items such as Ultimate Charge jewel, Ultimate Duration jewel, Guild Points jewel, and Paladin.

If the total score meets the require threshold, the guild rank will level up for the next event. Guild Event difficulty is tied to the rank of the guild, not to individual progression.
