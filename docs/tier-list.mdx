# Tier List

## S+ Tier

### Barbarian

```
Lucky Draw
Lucky Wheel
```

He starts off average to above-averge but once you get him into ascended gear, and buffed with globals from other heroes, he starts to show his true potential. He has the highest damage ceiling in the game and he excels at taking on late game content. You can use him earlier but results may feel lackluster. Given the highest damage ceiling, as he takes on harder content and begins to take some damage, he begins to increase his own damage, showing just how devastating he can be with his axes.

`Excels in`: Late game progression. Guild Event. Farming in HM stages such as Toxic Jungle 5. If Lucky Wheel item collection returns, he is the best at looting it due to increased movement speed during his rage.

### Monk

```
Lucky Draw
Lucky Wheel
```

Monk is a hero with a kit that is designed around shields and survivability. At the moment his weapon evolution is broken and abusing that allows him to be very good at Guild Events and other modes. Given his design, he is able to handle harder content of the game.

`Forge Update`: With the evo changes, he is capable of clearing end game content, fully AFK due to push back and evasion from his skills whilst dealing a fair bit of damage. Even if he doesn't outdamage Barbarian, he allows for an easier, even AFK, progression of end game content.

`Excels in`: Mid to End game progression. Guild Event and possibly even Arena.
  
## S Tier

### Reaper

```
Lucky Draw
Lucky Wheel
```

He starts off below average to average and is heavily reliant on being able to hit enemies to charge his ultimate which is where he really shows off how strong he is. To this effect, if you are using him in earlier content against easier enemies, your other weapons kill off the monster and he does not really get to shine. He is also slow and relies on getting his cooldown capped. His full potentially really shows when you take him into end game content where the enemies are more tanky and he gets to rip them to shreads with his ultimate. Similarly, he is best known for high rank Guild Events during the elite phase of the fight where he can charge up the ultimate to show you why he is called the Reaper.

`Excels in`: Late game progression. High rank Guild Event. High rank Arena.  

### Clockwork Mage

```
Lucky Draw
Lucky Wheel
```

Clock can take some getting used to when you first get her. Being used to facing your hero towards the enemy, you'll see that Clock instead attacks to the sides. However this is advantageous if you wedge her between two environmental obstacles. Forcing enemies to converge from the sides, her chrono disks will continously slow them down and once her ultimate charges, she slows them even more whilst putting them through the grinder. She is a strong hero from early game all the way to late game. She can also achieve Arena 20 full clear with lower gear and talent requirements. She is great for AFK farming in stages where you can force enemies into the choke points. Overall a really good hero for almost all modes.

`Excels in`: Early to Late progression. Guild Events. Arena. AFK Farming.

## A+ Tier

### Blade Master

```
Gems
```

He begins his journey without much to offer since he is very reliant on his ultimate which makes you take no damage from enemies. This allows players to use his ultimate to cheese their way through harder content in the game such as late game chapters and high rank Arena. He does require legendary gear to start showing his potential. He is overall one of the best heroes around and the champion within the pool of

standard

 gem heroes.

`Excels in:` Cheesing his way through hard content. Very good choice for clearing arena, especially if -100% instant kill curse. Do note he will not be good if there is a crit chance curse.
  
## A Tier

### Knight

```
Starter Hero
```

He is the best starter hero while you wait to get someone better. He is quite tanky which helps early game progression. Don't under-estimate this guy just because he is a starter hero. Once you get his weapon evolution, he begins to dominate in Arena and can survive late game chapters as well. Decent hero overall, but not ideal if you want higher scores in dungeon / guild event due to pushback.

`Excels in:` With weapon evolution he can take on high rank Arena and late game chapters. Not great for farming / Dungeon / Guild Event due to pushback within his kit.
  
### Paladin

```
Guild Tokens
```

This hammer wielder is a strong mid game hero and easier to use compared to Blade Master. Decent hero overall, but not ideal if you want higher scores in dungeon / guild event due to pushback. He is capable of taking on high rank Arena. Downside, he requires 1500 guild tokens to unlock which can take a while to earn, and early / mid players might benefit more from Ultimate jewels from the guild store instead. He will begin to fall off once you get to the late game chapters.

`Excels in:` Arena, Early to Mid game progression.

### The Oracle

```
Current Adventure
```

This magic council hero is quite strong especially for mid game. She does well for AFK farming, Arena, Guild Event and Dungeon too especially from level 80 once her ultimate comes online. She can be build towards perma-ultimate which is reliant on her being to kill enemies relatively quickly. This however is her downfall since it will lead to poor survivability for late game content.

`Excels in:` Early to Mid game progression, AFK farming, Arena, Guild Event and Dungeon.
  
## B+ Tier

### Assassin

```
Lucky Draw
Lucky Wheel
```

This ninja is a strong early and mid game hero. Amazing for AFK farming with his auto target basic attacks. Whilst he is strong for mid game, needing to charge his ultimate via kills will lead him to get slower in charging up which leads him to fall off later on in late game content. He also especially shines in dungeon and in boss brawl.

`Excels in:` Early to Mid game progression. Best AFK farmer. Amazing in Dungeon and Boss Brawl.
  
### Dark Paladin

```
Birthday Lucky Wheel
```

Strong damage output. His ultimate hits around him which is useful in targetting enemies that are behind. Has a tanky global.

More tests will reveal how he performs and where he shines.

## Below the Line

## B Tier

The heroes from this point forward are not all that special. Whilst they may standout here and there, generally a few of them can be good from early to mid but fall off rather quickly. As such you can use them, push them to their limits with your gear, but ideally you want to try for BladeMaster or one of the above adventure heroes.

### Fire Wizard

```
Gems 
```

Good for early game. New players can get him free after logging in for a week. The second best at dungeon event.

### Frost Wizard

```
Gems
```

Good for early game but falls off.

### Arcane Mage

```
Starter Hero
```

Best free hero for AFK farming keys in Hard Mode 1 if you don't have Assassin.

### Big Game Hunter

```
Lucky Draw
Lucky Wheel
```

 Top numbers in boss brawl.

### Tide Warden

```
Lucky Draw
Lucky Wheel
```

Decent early to mid game hero but falls off later on. Some improvement with forge but nothing significant.

### Pirate Queen

```
Lucky Draw
Lucky Wheel
```

Nothing special, just slightly stronger than C tier.

## C+ Tier

### Spirit Shaman

```
Gems
```

Fodder for globals. Strong for early game, though not necessary since saved gems are better spent towards Blade Master. She does get stronger once you have her weapon evolved and she can AFK farm Toixc Jungle 5 HM.

### Santa Lucky

```
Wheel
```

Best for early / mid game farming (library to toxic jungle). Even then needs forge upgrades of weapons for survivability. Most useful in December. Weaker in later stages and thus stronger heroes may even outfarm him. Highly gear dependent to survive the harder sections of mid-game.

## C Tier

### Dark Ranger

```
Gems
```

Fodder for globals

### Crazy Tinkerer

```
Gems
```

Gold Fodder for globals

### Warlock

```
Lucky Draw
Lucky Wheel
```

Fodder for globals

### Dragon Empress

```
Lunar New Year
Merchant
```

Unable to handle late game content.
Does really well in GE (might need ascended gear to really shine)

Globals help for farming coins.

### Artificer

```
Adventure
```

Cannot handle late game content. Does well in GE. Likely just an AFK hero for those who missed Assassin.

Global Fodder. Unimpressive thus far.

We will see what more testing reveals

## D Tier

### Frost Queen

```
Lucky Wheel
```

Poor survivability, cannot be used to AFK. May place better in future with forge upgrades.

## Unranked

### Unknown

```
Next Adventure
